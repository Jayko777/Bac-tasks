      <strong>The E60 M5</strong> was introduced in <em>2004</em>, with a V10
      engine and 7-speed paddle-shift SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox)
      transmission linking the car with the BMW Sauber Formula One
      program.[47][48] The E60 M5 was the world's first production sedan to use
      a V10 gasoline engine. This generation of the M5 was also built in the E61
      Touring (wagon) body style, which was only sold in Europe. The E63/E64 M6
      coupé and convertible are based on a shortened version of the M5 chassis
      and largely use the same mechanical components. Sedan- rear 3/4 view
      Wagon- front 1/4 view The official 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration
      figure is 4.7 seconds for the sedan,[49] however magazine tests have
      recorded figures down to <u><b>4.1 seconds</b></u
      >.[50] The E60 M5 was the fastest 4-door sedan available at the time of
      its introduction;[51] top speed is electronically restricted to 250 km/h
      (155 mph)[49] but could be raised to 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional
      M-driver's package.[52] The M5 has recorded a Nürburgring lap time of
      8:13.[53][54] Upgrades over regular 5 Series models include a wider track,
      unique body panels, a colourful heads up display featuring navigation,
      control messages, speed, rpm and gear selection information, automated
      seat side bolsters, heated/ventilated seats and power rear curtain. The
      larger, flared front guards on either side also featured cooling vents,
      reminiscent of the 1970s BMW CSL. The wheels were of 19-inch diameter and
      the car has quad exhaust pipes at the rear.
